# Episode Transcription

Hello everyone and welcome to _THE_ .NET Core podcast - the only podcast which is devoted to:

- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR

and not forgetting The .NET Core community, itself.

I am your host, Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor, and this is episode 7: Blogging 3.0 with Jeff Fritz. In this episode I interviewed Jeff Fritz about live coding, building communities, and the process of managing open source projects via his live coding show. Some of you may know Jeff from his C Sharp Fritz and Friends live stream on Twitch and Mixer; his work at Progress Telerik; or his work as Program Manager at Microsoft.

So lets site back, open up a terminal, type dotnet new podcast and let the show begin

### Jeff's Introduction

My name is Jeff Fritz, I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft, I work on the .NET Community Team, and I help folks to learn a little bit more about what we're doing with .NET, .NET Core, Visual Studio. And I help get folks connected with various resources they need at Microsoft events or get materials published out to the community. So everybody can be successful with .NET; learn a little bit about programming, whether it's the web, mobile applications using Xamarin, or building applications on Windows.

So I do a little bit of everything around the .NETs.

### Advice on Starting Your Own Live Streaming Channel

**Jamie**:
Do you have any advice for anyone who wants to get started in the live streaming/teaching situation that you found yourself in?

**Jeff**:
I would suggest, if you're going to consider getting involved with live streaming, be ready to get involved and committed at the same level that you would with a blog or podcast. Predictable repetition and schedule is extremely important with the stream, just as important as it is with your release schedule for a podcast, with being able to blog once or twice a week, at a minimum, so that you get people coming back and reading your articles. It's the same level of commitment.

But once you do have that time that you can commit to that, then to say

> What do I need after that?

As long as you have a good Internet connection, you have a decent video card so that you can do the video rendering appropriately, and quickly so that it is rendered and transmitted live as you're presenting, there's no other real expenses that you need to get into to get up and running with streaming.

Figure out your niche, figure out what it is that you want to share, figure out what you want to work on, and the tools are free out there. You can download OBS - the Open Broadcaster Software - that's at [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com/). You can grab that, get it configured very easily, it's got a number of tutorials from all kinds of folks out there, showing how to use it, how to configure it. And it's becoming easier to use all the time.

But that's really the Swiss Army Knife, the tool that everybody uses to stream. Don't worry about getting involved with all the stuff you see the gamer folks do, but there are things that you can easily setup and add in to a production that make it really fun, and interactive and interesting to your viewers.

The thing that you need to remember is that you're not just teaching, but you're entertaining people. They've tuned in to watch, to learn something, and to have a good time; if they're not having a good time, if they're bored, if they're falling asleep, if they're not hearing things from you that they like - if they're not with what it is you're saying - if you're talking about things that would upset folks. Then you're gonna lose viewers, that's not why they're tuned in to watch you.

So it's easy to get up and running, keep those couple of tips in mind, and you can certainly get up and running very quickly with minimal effort. But when you want to start polishing; you want to start making things better; you really want to go after some great content; you want to make your presentation look better, feel better. There's a whole bunch of tools and hardware out there that you can get that'll really make your stream, your video presentation, look absolutely professional.
