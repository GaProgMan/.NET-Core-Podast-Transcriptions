# Episode Transcription

Hello everyone and welcome to _THE_ .NET Core podcast - the only podcast which is devoted to:

- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR
- and not forgetting The .NET Core community, itself

I am your host, Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor, and this is episode 0: An Introduction to the Podcast. In this episode, I'll tell you why I created this podcast, what my goals for it are, and what you should expect from listening to it.

So lets open a terminal, type `dotnet new podcast` and let the show begin

##### Introduction - Who Am I?

Hello everyone, this is Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor. You may recognise my voice from the [Waffling Taylors](https://wafflingtaylors.rocks/) or [Dev Otaku](https://devotaku.com/) podcasts, or from my guest appearances on the [Cynical Developer](https://cynicaldeveloper.com/) podcast. This is the first episode of what will hopefully become a very frequent .NET Core specific podcast.

The idea here is that I'd noticed that there aren't any podcasts which are directly related to and specific to .NET Core. Sure, there are a lot of .NET Framework specific and Microsoft specific podcasts (and even a few development podcasts) which have had episodes on .NET Core and have featured prominent figures from the .NET Core community; but there aren't any which are specifically about .NET Core. I'm hoping to change that.

My goal for this podcast is to be _THE_ .NET Core podcast - it's why I picked that name. I want the episodes of this podcast to cover:

- .NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Core
- SignalR
- .NET Standard

To that end, I'm hoping to create a whole bunch of episodes about those topics, reach out to the .NET Core community, talk to developers who use .NET Core - I want to talk with them about the differences and similarities between .NET Core and .NET Framework. Things like:

- The developer experience
- Tooling support
- OS support

I'm also going to be looking to folks who haven't used .NET Core, but have used other .NET platforms (Mono and Xamarin, for instance), and we'll talk about what might be stopping them from moving over to Core.

I'm even hoping to reach out to a few folks from the core teams at Microsoft - the folks who are right at the forefront of the .NET Core technology.

##### Why Me?

So who am I and what makes me so special? Why should I create a .NET Core podcast? Why shouldn't someone from Microsoft create one?

Well, there are a few podcasts which have covered specific parts of .NET Core - shows like the [MS Dev Show](https://msdevshow.com/) do a wonderful job of having people on from both Microsoft and the community at large.

There's [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/), another fantastic podcast. The hosts of this show talk about .NET Core and .NET Standard.

Even shows like the [Cynical Developer](httsp://cynicaldeveloper.com/) - again, I've been on two episodes of that talking about .NET Core and how I think its a brilliant thing. But again, that's a show which touches lightly on each of the subjects rather than a deep dive, which is what I'm hoping for this show.

Even Shows like Steve "Ardalis" Smith's [Weekly Dev Tips Show](http://www.weeklydevtips.com/)contains amazing nuggets of information for any developer. Granted, he does use ASP.NET Core and .NET Core as a background for these tips. But it is mostly a dev related podcast, rather than a .NET Core or EF Core specific podcast. But that makes the advice given by Steve, and the Coding Blocks folks, and the MS Dev Show, and the Cynical Developer folks, and all of the other podcasts perfect for any developer, regardless of their language or framework.

And that's actually dumbing down all of the hard work that this folks put in. They put in a _lot_ of effort, you know.

But I feel like there's a gap, and I want to fill that gap.

I've been writing about .NET Core since around November 2016 - I'd been using it for a while before then, but I've been writing about it and participating in the community since November 2016. If you ask any of the people I know outside of development, and they'll be like:

> Oh, Jamie? He never shuts up about that NET Core thing.

that's not quite true

> and he's always talking about .NET Core and how brilliant it is

I mean, it's pretty swish. Plus, at this point (as this episode is recorded) I have a year and a half of experience of writing about and in .NET Core, and you can find all of that if you head over to [dotnetcore.gaprogman.com](https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com) or send me a tweet [@dotnetcoreblog](https://twitter.com/dotnetcoreblog/) - I'll add links in the show notes.

##### And Why Now?

But why start a .NET Core podcast now? Why not 2 years ago when the .NET Core 1.x RTM was on the horizon? Well, there's an old adage which states: wait for version 2 - that way all of the release bugs are ironed out. Sure, Version 1.x was a game changer, but there were a lot of issues with it (as we'll cover on a soon to be released episode on .NET Standard). Things like system.xml were missing, and there was a lot of backlash about UI and the fact that Microsoft didn't ship a cross platform UI framework. But, as we'll find out in a later episode, there are tonnes of solutions for this - including an promised update for a specific framework whose name begins with an X.

What about the future of this podcast? Well, I've already got the next 14 episodes planned out and ready to go - pro tip for all budding podcasters: have a bunch of episodes ready to go _BEFORE_ you release anything.

What about the future of the podcast?

The current plan is to release monthly episodes, and see how people react to it. I might be completely wrong, and a .NET Core podcast might not be needed, but I have a feeling that there's a gap in the market for .NET Core specific podcasts. So all of you who want to be my competitors should jump in and create your own .NET Core podcasts - that way we can compare notes.

So that's going to do it for this episode. Remember to check the show notes (in whatever podcatcher you are using) for a bunch of useful links, and to head over to [dotnetcore.gaprogman.com](https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com) to read all of the stuff that I've written about .NET Core - I'll warn you though, most of my articles are pretty long (we're talking 1.5 to 3 thousand words).

I also have a YouTube account where I post all of my development videos - I'm working through a bunch of projects at the moment and live streaming them (there will be a link in the show notes). Everything that I put up on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieTaylorDotNetCore) is live streamed on Twitch (that's [twitch.tv/gaprogman](https://twitch.tv/gaprogman/)) before it goes up on YouTube - so if you want to be involved and connect with my whilst I'm working on something, head over there.

Let me know in the comments, or send me a tweet, and let me know whether you're actually interested in a .NET Core podcast. After all, I might be wrong and there might not be a gap in the market for a .NET Core podcast. And if you know other developers who are interested in .NET Core let them know about the show - you lucky listeners are in at the beginning, so you'll be able to take the journey into podcast wonderland with me.

Anyway, I'll leave it there before I start waffling on too much. Hopefully, I'll catch you again in another (longer) episode.
