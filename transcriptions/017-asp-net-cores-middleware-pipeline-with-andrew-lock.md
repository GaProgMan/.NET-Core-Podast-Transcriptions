# Episode Transcription

Hello everyone and welcome to _THE_ .NET Core podcast - the only podcast which is devoted to:

- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR

and not forgetting The .NET Core community, itself.

I am your host, Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor, and this is episode 17: ASP.NET Core's Middleware Pipeline with Andrew Lock. In this episode I interviewed Andrew Lock about the ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline. Some of you may know Andrew Lock from his recently published book [ASP.NET Core in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/asp-net-core-in-action) or [his blog](https://andrewlock.net/).

So lets sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and let the show begin.

### Andrew Lock Introduction

People will probably mostly know me from my [blog](https://andrewlock.net/). I started that about two and a half year ago, and that's been just basically about ASP.NET Core.

I'm currently a software developer at a company in London called [Elevate Direct](https://www.elevatedirect.com/) and I'm living in Plymoth, so I'm working remotely. And my job is on the back end .NET services and APIs, and at the moment I'm mostly converting ASP.NET stuff to ASP.NET Core.

### Wrapping Up

That was my interview with Andrew Lock.

Be sure to check out the show notes for a bunch of links to some of the stuff that we covered, and a collection of text snippets from the interview. The show notes, as always, can be found at [dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/).

And don't forget to spread the word, leave me a rating or review on your podcatcher of choice, and to come back next time for more .NET Core goodness.

I will see you again real soon. See you later folks.
