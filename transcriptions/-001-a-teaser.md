# Episode Transcription
Hello everyone and welcome to _THE_ .NET Core podcast - the only podcast which is devoted to:

- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Core
- EF Core
- SignalR
- and not forgetting The .NET Core community, itself

I am your host, Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor, and this is episode -1: A Teaser. In this episode, I'll briefly introduce you to the podcast, the format, talk about how often you can expect to hear it, and where you might it.

So lets open a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and let the show begin

##### A Teaser?

That's right. There's nothing wrong with having a teaser episode, right?

I'm not going to go too deeply into what this podcast is about (because that's the point of Episode 0 - which should be dropping in a few days), but I did want to show off the basic format of the show and talk about what you might expect from it.

So firstly, I don't work for Microsoft I'm just a developer who has been working with .NET Core for 2 years (since around the RTM) and has been writing about it for almost as long. Additionally, any views or opinions that I express during the course of this podcast are mine and are in no way related to Microsoft or any of their subsidiaries.

The first few episodes of the podcast are going to be me setting things up and providing you with a little bit of history and background framing. I've got episodes lined up which cover:

- The History of .NET Core
- Getting Started with .NET Core
- What the .NET Standard is?
- What Mono is?
- ASP.NET Core itself

And I'll be expanding that list in the coming weeks. The idea is to give you a little background information on what these things are before diving into the hows and whys.

I'm also reaching out to developers within the community to get their opinions on .NET Core (and all the other Cores), so keep an eye (or I guess an ear?) out for those.

The current plan is to release episodes once every two weeks. That may pan out, it may not pan out - it depends on:

- How long the episodes become
- How many guests I can get on
- What the topics are

that kind of thing.

Like I say, the current plan is once every two weeks.

##### But Where Can I Get The Podcast?

As I record this episode, I'm in the process of setting everything up; but once it's launched you'll be able to listen to the show via:

- The show's website
  - [https://dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show)
  - that's also where you'll find the show notes
  - on each of the episode posts there will be an embedded player which will let you play the episode
- The official libsyn page
  - [http://thedotnetcorepodcast.libsyn.com/](http://thedotnetcorepodcast.libsyn.com/)
- Your podcatcher of choice, some of my favourites are:
  - Pocket Casts
  - Podchaser
  - Google Podcasts
  - Apple Podcasts
  - Spotify

If you can't find the podcast on your service of choice, there's also a link on the home page - [https://dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show) - to the RSS feed; so you should be able to put that into your podcatcher and catch all of the episodes as they get released.

You'll also find episode show notes on the website. Each episode will have a full set of show notes, including a transcription and useful links. Now, each episode that I release, in the description, there'll be a short introduction to the episode and then a link to the full show notes.

So be sure to click the link in the show notes for the episode, to get a  full version of the show notes... if that makes sense.

If you want to connect with me, you can do so over at twitter I'm [@dotnetcoreblog](https://twitter.com/dotnetcoreblog). You can also read all of the things that I've written about .NET Core over at [https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com](https://dotnetcore.gaprogman.com)

I'll leave it there, I think - except to say that Episode 0 will be appearing in the feeds, and then pushed out to your podcatchers, in a few days.

See you later folks.
